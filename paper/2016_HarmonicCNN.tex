% Convnets have rocked MIR
Convolutional neural networks, originally pioneered in computer vision, have shown great performance across a variety of tasks in audio analysis.
% Operate on time-freq reps, which are not images
In vision applications, convolutional networks exploit statistical regularities in spatial locality, \emph{e.g.}, neighboring pixels.
However, in audio, these models typically operate on time-frequency representations, which exhibit different statistical properties from natural images.
% Sound is harmonic, and model assumptions may not hold.
Although time-frequency bins do exhibit local regularities, modeling only these local interactions ignores the relationships between harmonically related frequencies.
% Make input rep harmonic, does it matter?
To better adapt convolutional networks to audio, we craft an alternative input representations that aims to exploit this known behavior directly.
%and determine what effect these have on the efficacy of the learned model.
% How do we do it?
We study this approach in a large, solo instrument classification task, and examine how model architecture influences performance.
% What do we find?
%Experimental results show that the use of harmonic convolutions leads to better generalization, faster computation time, and more compact models per unit of performance.
% Closeout
Finally, we provide an open source framework to reproduce both our results and the data used herein.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

% Deep learning, so hot right now... deep learning.
Many classic tasks in MIR aim to develop computational systems for modeling the human perception of music signals to achieve robust content understanding at scale, e.g. tens of millions of tracks.
In the last several years, a number of research communities have fully embraced feature learning and deep networks, which excel at modeling the kinds of complex, nonlinear behavior found in acoustic signals.
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are now an especially common choice for MIR tasks, finding use in timbre modelling, chord estimation, onset detection, structural segmentation, on so on.

It is worth noting that convolutional networks draw inspiration from biological vision systems \cite{Hubel1964, LeCun1998}, and common implementations have been architected with computer vision in mind.
CNNs are characterized by two features:
one, local receptive fields exploit statistical properties of natural images, i.e. neighboring pixels tend to be more correlated than distant ones;
and two, weights over these local receptive fields are shared across spatial dimensions, providing translation invariant features.

We can visualize why this is a good idea.
Here, we take the CIFAR dataset, which consists of small (32x32) images.
We use the training set of 25k images, compute a 2D auto-correlation between each image and a slightly cropped version of itself, and average over the dataset;
this is defined formally by the following.
As expected, \Cref{fig:image_corr} illustrates that neighboring pixels are better correlated than those at a distance, and there is little observable bias in either dimension.

Intuitively, time-frequency representations are not images, but much previous work overlooks this reality, applying the standard CNN formulation to audio tasks.
This raises an interesting question: how do these correlations differ from images, and can we similarly leverage this prior knowledge?
We therefore repeat the same exercise, instead drawing observations from constant-Q representations of audio.
Using the librosa toolkit, we compute CQT spectra over a number of recordings in the USPop dataset\cite{Ellis2002} and draw 25k windowed observations at random.
As before, the valid, 2D auto-correlation is performed between each windowed observation and a cropped version of itself.
Given in \Cref{fig:cqt_corr}, there are two notable distinctions.
First, consistent with intuition, the CQT representation exhibits strong correlations with harmonically related frequencies, being the octave (2:1), fifth (3:2), and major third (4:3).
Second, these correlations are not symmetrical in frequency.

In this work, we apply Harmonic Convolution Neural Networks (HCNNs) to the task of solo music instrument classification, using a newly standardized dataset referred to the Music INSTrument (MINST) dataset.
%The remainder of the paper is organized as follows:
%Section II details our approach to exploiting correlations in convolutional networks;
%Section III describes the experimental method used in this work;
%and Section IV discusses results and conclusions drawn therein.

        \emph{Full} connectivity (blue) requires that the filter connect to all frequency bins in a temporal window around the center frame.
        \emph{Frequency-local} connectivity (green) only connects a filter to near-by frequencies.

\label{figs:filter-shapes}
\end{figure}
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) derive their expressive power by modeling ``local'' statistical regularities.
As illustrated in \Cref{figs:filter-shapes}, there are a variety of ways to model ``locality'' in spectrogram representations.

Arguably the simplest method is to model the entire frequency range over a short time window.  
This method, denoted as \emph{Full} in \Cref{figs:filter-shapes} requires filter coefficients which span the entire frequency axis of the spectrogram.
While this model makes the fewest possible assumptions about independence among frequencies, it also cannot be made pitch-invariant since the filter cannot move along the frequency axis.
Consequently, it may take a large number of filters --- each with a large number of coefficients --- and thus a large amount of training data to model the relatively simply phenomenon of pitch modulation.
However, this approach has been demonstrated to be effective for high-level tasks. %TODO: cite sander, maybe pablo, eric, etc\ldots

The second approach uses smaller filters, which can be moved along the frequency axis.
For this approach to properly generate pitch-invariant features, the frequency axis of the spectrogram must be logarithmically spaced, as in the constant-Q transform (CQT).
This method, denoted as \emph{Frequency-local} in \Cref{figs:filter-shapes}, is closely related to the local receptive field filters used in computer vision applications.
Frequency-local filters can therefore capture highly localized characteristics of sound, such as attack profile or vibrato, but cannot directly capture properties derived from distant frequencies, such as timbre.
Higher-level properties can be modeled by subsequent processing layers, and this approach has been shown to be effective for intermediate-level tasks such as instrument recognition. %self-cite. TODO: eric, did you use this for chords?


Recently, Lostanlen and Cella~\cite{lostanlen2016} proposed a variant of the Frequency-local approach in which filters are connected to small time-frequency patches tiled across multiple octaves.
This method is depicted in \Cref{figs:filter-shapes} as \emph{octave-local}.
As the illustration shows, this connectivity scheme allows for a filter to be pitch-invariant while modeling local time-frequency statistics as well as broad spectrum properties.
Consequently, this approach --- when used in combination with the previous two methods --- demonstrated superior performance for instrument recognition, which requires both pitch-invariance and broad-spectrum models.
Note, however, that connections are only included to frequencies related by an integer power of 2 to the bottom time-frequency patch.
Octave-local design therefore disregards odd harmonics, which can be highly informative for determining the timbre of a sound.
%We also note that Lostanlen's implementation limited the octave neighborhood to span three octaves.

%The facets we consider differently are...

\subsection{Harmonic CNNs}

The proposed harmonic CNN (HCNN) is a straightforward extension of the previous methods.
Rather than connect a filter to time-frequency patches which are in octave relation to each other (as in the octave-local model), the HCNN connects time-frequency patches which are related by integer multiples.
This connectivity pattern is illustrated in the final column of \Cref{figs:filter-shapes} (harmonic-local).
Note that the harmonic-local pattern is able to capture the odd harmonics (third and fifth)  of the fundamental (around 500Hz) which are missed by the frequency- and octave-local models.

\subsection{HCNN Implementation}

Formally, we define the HCNN operation as a function parametrized by coefficients $w \in \mathbb{R}^{F \times T \times H}$, where $F$ denotes the number of frequency bins, $T$ denotes the number of time frames, and $H$ denotes the number of harmonics to model:
\begin{equation}
    g_w(X)_{t, k} := 
    \sum_{\substack{
        h \in \{1, 2, \cdots, H\}\\
        i \in \{-\lfloor T/2\rfloor, \cdots, \lfloor T/2 \rfloor\}\\
        j \in \{-\lfloor F/2\rfloor, \cdots, \lfloor F/2 \rfloor\}}
    }
    \hspace{-3em}%
    w_{ijh} \cdot X^h\left(t + i,\; k + j\right)\label{eq:hcnn}
\end{equation}
where $X^h(t, k)$ denotes the $h$th harmonic of frequency at bin $k$ and time $t$.

% Octave-local is easy: just wrap the cqt
Note that the octave-local model can be recovered from \cref{eq:hcnn} by taking a subset of harmonics $h=2^n$ for integer $n$.
For a CQT with $B$ bins per octave and minimum basis frequency $f_{\min}$, we have bases frequencies defined by
\begin{equation}
    f_k = 2^{k/B} \cdot f_{\min}, \label{eq:cqtfreqs}
\end{equation}
and for any $f_k$, its $2^n$ harmonic will be located at $f_{k + (n-1)\cdot B}$.
The octave-local model can therefore be implemented efficiently by standard 2-dimensional CNN frameworks by reshaping the CQT into a three-dimensional array parametrized by (time, pitch class, octave number).\footnote{To avoid boundary effects, Lostanlen and Cella use a redundant encoding where the ``pitch class'' dimension spans more than one octave.}
The octave dimension thus plays a role similar to color channels in image processing, since the selected harmonics align exactly along the ``octave'' dimension.

% Harmonic is trickier, since the spacing is not fixed in CQT space
The general harmonic CNN is somewhat more difficult to implement.
The $h$th harmonic of a frequency $f_k$ will not generally coincide with an integer bin index $j$, since this would require
\begin{eqnarray}
    f_j = 2^{j/B} \cdot f_{\min} &=& h \cdot 2^{k/B}\cdot f_{\min} = h \cdot f_k \notag \\
    % 2^{j/B} = h * 2^{k/B}
    % j/B = log_2 h + k/B
    % j = k + B log_2 h
\Rightarrow \quad j &=& k + B \cdot \log_2 h,
\end{eqnarray}
which is not an integer for $h \neq 2^n$.
\Cref{eq:hcnn} cannot be directly implemented on a CQT without resorting to some form of approximation (\emph{e.g.}, interpolation between frequency bands).
%Moreover, the octave-wrapping approach does not preserve index locality for ${h \neq 2^k}$, so the resulting representation would not be amenable to use with standard frameworks.
Moreover, because the harmonically related patches are not evenly spaced along the frequency axis, there is no simple reshaping of the spectrogram that would simultaneously align patches for use with standard 2D convolution operators.

% Solution: use harmonic planes! analogous to color channels
%           + volumetric filters
Instead of octave-wrapping, we generate $H$ constant-Q transforms $X^1, X^2, \dots, X^H$ for a given input signal.
$X^1$ is defined as a CQT with minimum basis frequency $f^1_{\min}$.
For $h > 1$, we scale the minimum basis frequency to
\begin{equation}
    f^h_{\min} := h \cdot f^1_{\min}.\label{eq:fmin}
\end{equation}
By the definition of the CQT, the subsequent basis frequencies also scale by a factor of $h$ in relation to the original:
\begin{eqnarray}
    f^h_k &=& 2^{k/B} \cdot f^h_{\min}\\
        &=& 2^{k/B} \cdot h \cdot f^1_{\min}\\
    &=& h \cdot f^1_k.
\end{eqnarray}
This implies that for all frequency bins $k$, the $h$th harmonic of $X^1_{t, k}$ is located at $X^h_{t, k}$, as illustrated in \Cref{fig:hcnn}.
Collecting all $(X^h)_{h=1}^H$ into a three-dimensional array indexed by (time, frequency, harmonic) thus preserves index locality, and \cref{eq:hcnn} can be computed with standard 2-dimensional CNN frameworks.


% Note: if this is too expensive for you, harmonics can be approximated on the fly by linear interpolation.  We leave this as future work.
%TODO: make a figure showing the harmonic planes

    A single HCNN filter connects to the same time-frequency indices across all harmonic channels (indicated in red), just as color image filters connect to the same spatial coordinates across all color channels.}

\section{Method}\label{sec:typeset_text}

The width (time) of the filters should match that of MH: above I suggested 5x5, but I think 7x7 might be better since it captures +- 1 semitone from the center bin. In M2, this translates to +- 3 semitones. For MF, layer 1 will be full-height by 7.

For layer 2 in MF, the input will have shape (n[1], 1, T - 7//2); frequency information is collapsed out by valid-mode convolution, and we effectively have two-dimensional data (filter number, time). Layer 2 filters then must have shape like (1, width), and the width may as well match the width of layer 2 in MH/M2 (I suggested 9x9 above).

After that, we max-pool over time and feed into dense layer just as in the other architectures.




\subsection{The MINST Dataset}\label{subsec:body}

% Issues with audio datasets
Training and evaluating supervised machine learning approaches on MIR tasks faces a near-universal issue of data.
% Not many open-audio datasets that can be shared.
While many researchers have built or leveraged labeled collections of audio, concerns of copyright undermine the reproducibility of results.
% Data integrity issues, many MIR tasks are subjective, raising issues of evaluation and the use of ground truth.
In many instances though, collections that do provide access to audio data suffer from questions of validity and integrity, such as GTZAN \cite{Sturm} or Ballroom \cite{Sturm}, or focus on subjective tasks which raise issues of ``ground truth''.
% Seldom large in size
Complementing these issues, large audio datasets are uncommon,
Combined, these challenges make it difficult to form robust conclusions across experiments and researchers.

Sizeable, open, and objective of datasets like MNIST \cite{}, CIFAR \cite{}, and NORB \cite{}, however, have served the computer vision community well in the last two decades, helping lead to a number of breakthroughs in the field.
It is hard to imagine, for example, where the community would be without the early role served by MNIST.
Here, we strive to develop a similarly standardized data by building on top of previous efforts in the MIR community to build collections of solo instrument samples.

Here, we combine a number of open datasets in a common manner to yield the Music Instrument dataset, dubbed MINST\footnote{\url{http://github.com/ejhumphrey/minst-dataset}}, in honor of its handwritten digit counterpart.
Note onsets are annotated semi-automatically;
a number of onset detection methods are applied, and subsequently verified or corrected manually, as needed.
These reference note onsets are then used to segment longer recordings into individual notes.
Here, each note is trimmed to a constant 1-second duration; where observed notes are shorter than this, a -65dBFS Gaussian noise signal is appended.
This results in nearly 39k note observations from 13 instrument classes, spanning 3 different corpora:
UIowa Music Instrument Samples\footnote{}, RWC\footnote{}, and Philharmonia\footnote{}.
The data used herein is made freely available online\footnote{}.
